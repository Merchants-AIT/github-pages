In this exercise, you will:

1. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Configure your site
1. Customize your home page

<summary>Having trouble? ü§∑</summary><br/>

When copying the exercise, we recommend the following settings:

- For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.

- We recommend creating a public repository, since private repositories will use Actions minutes.

If the exercise isn't ready in 20 seconds, please check the [Actions](../../actions) tab.

- Check to see if a job is running. Sometimes it simply takes a bit longer.

- If the page shows a failed job, please submit an issue. Nice, you found a bug! üêõ

User Guide
Globally install documentation using the npm package manager:

$ npm install -g documentation
This installs a command called documentation in your path, that you can point at JSDoc-annotated source code to generate human-readable documentation. First, run documentation with the --help option for help:

Usage:

# generate markdown docs for index.js and files it references
documentation build index.js -f md

# generate html docs for all files in src, and include links to source files in github
documentation build src/** -f html --github -o docs

# document index.js, ignoring any files it requires or imports
documentation build index.js -f md --shallow

# validate JSDoc syntax in util.js
documentation lint util.js

# update the API section of README.md with docs from index.js
documentation readme index.js --section=API

# build docs for all values exported by index.js
documentation build --document-exported index.js

# build html docs for a TypeScript project
documentation build index.ts --parse-extension ts -f html -o docs

Commands:
  build [input..] build documentation
  lint [input..] check for common style and uniformity mistakes
  readme [input..] inject documentation into your README.md

Options:
  --version Show version number [boolean]
  --help Show help [boolean]
Contributing
We have plenty of issues that we'd love help with.

Robust and complete JSDoc support, including typedefs.
Strong support for HTML and Markdown output

JSDoc.

JSDoc
Build status

An API documentation generator for JavaScript.

Want to contribute to JSDoc? Please read CONTRIBUTING.md.

Installation and Usage
JSDoc supports stable versions of Node.js 8.15.0 and later. You can install JSDoc globally or in your project's node_modules folder.

To install the latest version on npm globally (might require sudo; learn how to fix this):

npm install -g jsdoc
To install the latest version on npm locally and save it in your package's package.json file:

npm install --save-dev jsdoc
Note: By default, npm adds your package using the caret operator in front of the version number (for example, ^3.6.3). We recommend using the tilde operator instead (for example, ~3.6.3), which limits updates to the most recent patch-level version. See this Stack Overflow answer for more information about the caret and tilde operators.

If you installed JSDoc locally, the JSDoc command-line tool is available in ./node_modules/.bin. To generate documentation for the file yourJavaScriptFile.js:

./node_modules/.bin/jsdoc yourJavaScriptFile.js
If you installed JSDoc globally, run the jsdoc command:

jsdoc yourJavaScriptFile.js
By default, the generated documentation is saved in a directory named out. You can use the --destination (-d) option to specify another directory.

Run jsdoc --help for a complete list of command-line options.

Templates and tools
The JSDoc community has created templates and other tools to help you generate and customize your documentation. Here are a few of them:

Templates
jaguarjs-jsdoc
DocStrap (example)
jsdoc3Template (example)

Introduction
Docusaurus is a project for building, deploying, and maintaining open source project websites easily.

Short on time.  Check out our 5-minute tutorial ‚è±Ô∏è!

Tip: use docusaurus.new to test Docusaurus immediately in a playground.

Simple to Start
Docusaurus is built in a way so that it can get running in as little time as possible. We've built Docusaurus to handle the website build process so you can focus on your project.

Localizable
Docusaurus ships with localization support via CrowdIn. Empower and grow your international community by translating your documentation.

Customizable
While Docusaurus ships with the key pages and sections you need to get started, including a home page, a docs section, a blog, and additional support pages, it is also customizable as well to ensure you have a site that is uniquely yours.

Installation
Use the initialization CLI to create your site:

npm init docusaurus@latest
Read the docs for any further information.

Contributing
We've released Docusaurus because it helps us better scale and supports the many OSS projects at Meta. We hope that other organizations can benefit from the project. We are thankful for any contributions from the community.
